        The app draws inspiration from the animated movie <em>Ratatouille</em>{' '}
        and its message: <strong>‚ÄúAnyone can cook.‚Äù</strong> Whether you're an
        experienced chef or a complete beginner, this app is here to make meal
        planning simple and fun.
      </p>

      <h2>A Note on Security</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, the app doesn‚Äôt implement advanced security features, but I‚Äôm
        always open to feedback and ideas to improve it.
      </p>

      <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm constantly inspired by creative projects like the{' '}
        <strong>Dream Catcher app</strong>, which I highly recommend checking
        out! If you‚Äôd like to explore more of my work or stay in touch, feel
